# IBM-Data-Science

This is a complete Capstone project from IBM Data Science from Coursera with data from Space X. Since I am a member of the Columbia Space Initiative Rockets Team, I have a deeper emotional attachment to this project.

In the early stages, due to personal limitations, I may borrow techniques from others, but after that I will keep updating it until I am satisfied.
